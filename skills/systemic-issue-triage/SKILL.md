# Systemic Issue Triage

## Purpose

Triage verified issues by root class. Shrink the system by grouping shared causes instead of proposing one patch per report. Produce a bounded initiative candidate, then stop before design or delivery.

## Input Contract

- Before accessing repository evidence, run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` from the current working directory to resolve the repository that contains the current working directory.
- Treat that resolved root as the sole repository scope for triage. Repository reads, reproductions, tests, and evidence references must come from that root.
- Do not substitute another checkout, an issue-linked repository, a user-supplied path, or a copy described as newer or more complete. External trackers may provide source-issue evidence, but they do not change repository scope.
- If the repository root cannot be resolved unambiguously, including when the current working directory is outside Git, stop and ask the user to run the skill from the intended repository. Do not guess or fall back to another path.
- Verify source issues or tickets before classifying them. Preserve their identifiers and evidence references.
- Treat an issue's stated mechanism as a hypothesis; the observed symptom is evidence.
- If evidence is missing or the report cannot be classified, use Bucket E and ask the reporter. Do not guess.
- Reproduce claims when repository or runtime access exists. If access does not exist, mark the evidence pending and name the exact verification needed.

## Autonomous Intake

When invoked without issue identifiers or tracker links, perform the complete intake and triage in the same run:

1. From the resolved repository root, inspect `git remote get-url origin` and infer the issue tracker from the `origin` remote. The remote establishes tracker identity; it does not change repository scope.
2. Use the tracker-native CLI or API in read-only mode to enumerate every open issue. Follow pagination until exhaustion, include issues only rather than pull requests, and preserve each issue identifier and URL.
3. Read each issue's title, body, comments, and linked references needed to verify its observed symptoms, proposed mechanisms, dependencies, duplicates, and superseding work.
4. Verify the resulting source set against the CWD repository, reproduce claims when possible, then produce the complete Output Contract. Do not stop after inventory or defer triage to a later turn.

The requested artifact is the triage report itself, not a readiness explanation, execution plan, or review of this skill.

Do not ask the user to provide issue identifiers when they can be discovered from `origin`. If the tracker reports zero open issues, return a zero-count triage with no initiative candidate and `next skill: none`.

If the exhaustive inventory cannot be completed because `origin` is missing or ambiguous, the forge is unsupported, authentication or network access fails, or any page cannot be retrieved, fail closed. Name the exact failed command or verification needed; never present a partial issue set as the complete repository backlog.

When the user explicitly supplies issue identifiers or tracker links, triage that explicit source set instead of the autonomous all-open default.

## Root-Class Buckets

Every source issue belongs to exactly one bucket:

- **Bucket A — Superseded:** covered by an in-flight design change. Name the change and the named test evidence that will prove closure.
- **Bucket B — Duplicate:** another tracker owns the same known root class. Name the canonical tracker.
- **Bucket C — New defect:** a reproducible bug assigned to a root-cause cluster, never a standalone patch by default.
- **Bucket D — Feature request:** requested behavior rather than a defect. Keep it outside defect clusters unless evidence establishes one shared root.
- **Bucket E — Unclear:** insufficient evidence. Ask the reporter for the missing input instead of inventing a diagnosis.

Use the explicit labels `Bucket A`, `Bucket B`, `Bucket C`, `Bucket D`, and `Bucket E` in the output.

## Clustering Rules

- One root cause produces one cluster. Two or more issues with the same root become one candidate fix boundary.
- N issues do not justify N patches. A root-cause cluster must name every member and the evidence that binds them.
- Do not merge unrelated subsystems merely to reduce tracker count.
- Close issues against named test evidence, not promises or self-reported fixes.
- If a test for the issue's proposed mechanism already passes on unchanged code, the mechanism is wrong; strengthen reproduction around the observed symptom.
- A thread containing two distinct failure modes remains open until both are named and accounted for.
- A dead end without a runnable continuation is primarily a message/exit defect; do not build state machinery around it.

## System-Reduction Check

Before recommending an initiative boundary, ask whether the implied fix adds a state, verb, flag, gate, or parallel representation of existing truth. If it does, flag the growth and seek a boundary that deletes, relaxes, or consolidates instead.

Urgent flags include:

- a wrong or non-runnable exit;
- a gate shipped before the capability that satisfies it;
- a blocked user with no self-service continuation;
- production failure hidden by tests or fixtures taught to accept the defect.

## Output Contract

Return:

1. verified source issues and evidence references;
2. bucket counts;
3. a per-issue table with issue, bucket, root-cause cluster, and evidence;
4. root-cause clusters and their member issues;
5. the proposed initiative boundary, explicitly excluding unrelated clusters;
6. priority and dependency evidence;
7. urgent flags;
8. unresolved questions or pending verification;
9. `next skill: brainstorming` only when a coherent initiative candidate is ready for human approval; otherwise `next skill: none`.

Do not call a candidate approved on the user's behalf. After human approval, route the candidate to `brainstorming`.

## Scope Boundary

- Do not design the solution.
- Do not plan implementation.
- Do not implement fixes.
- Do not mutate issues, tickets, labels, comments, milestones, or project state.
- Do not reproduce `brainstorming`, `writing-plans`, or delivery workflows.
- Stop after reporting the triage result and recommended next skill.
